# PythonFogComputing
Objective is place the applications and its modules in the fog environment such that the energy consumption is as minimum as possible.
The other way of defining the problem is try not to place the applications in cloud, reduce this factor to as much as possible.
We built a Genetic Algorithm such the application placement is restricted to just the FN, FCN, NFCN.
